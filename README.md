# WebDevProject
This is a project created as part of a web development module in a masters level course in Software Development. 
For this project I created a fake commerce website. 
A dataset containing prices, description, image urls etc was taken from kaggle.com and edited to be less than 10,000 rows. 
The project involved a combination of front end and back end web development. A REST API was also created. 
The end result was 13 webpages including several which were restricted to admin users only. 
The website primarily advertised products based on the selected dataset. 
Additional functionality included community forum pages, sign up, login/logout and a complaints form. 
The final mark for this project was 77.
